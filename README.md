# Tab loom
A virtual sketchbook for creating guitar tablature with clickable chord and fretboard inputs

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You'll need to have Ruby v2.6.5 or later and Node v11.15.0 or later installed on your local development machine in order to host an instance of this application.

You'll also need to have yarn v1.22.4 or later and RubyGem v3.03 or later. These package managers are used to install the packages specifically used by Tab Loom.

### Installing
After cloning the repository to a local directory, open a terminal window, navigate to the root directory of the repository, and execute the following commands:
```
yarn install
```
```
bundle install
```
Troubleshooting: If the Ruby Gems don't install successfully, try running ```bundle exec bundle install``` instead of ```bundle install```. You can also try running the ```yarn install``` command before the ```bundle install``` command.
